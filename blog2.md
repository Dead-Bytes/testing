# Google I/O 2025: Ushering in the Agentic Era of AI

At Google I/O 2025, the tech giant unveiled a transformative vision for artificial intelligence, emphasizing the shift towards "agentic" AI‚Äîautonomous systems capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting on behalf of users. This evolution marks a significant departure from traditional reactive AI models, positioning AI as proactive agents in our digital lives.([Business Insider][1])

## ü§ñ Understanding Agentic AI

Agentic AI refers to systems that can make decisions and perform tasks without human intervention. Unlike conventional AI, which operates based on predefined rules or direct prompts, agentic AI continuously learns and adapts, enabling it to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. This paradigm shift is pivotal in creating AI that not only responds to user inputs but also anticipates needs and acts proactively. ([Wikipedia][2])
