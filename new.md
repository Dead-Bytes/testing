Alright â€” let's break it down carefully:

The grammar you gave is:

```
S â†’ AaAb | BbBa
A â†’ Îµ
B â†’ Îµ
```

You said:

* It is **CLR(1)** (Canonical LR(1)) âœ…
* You couldn't merge any states â†’ **LALR(1)** is same as CLR(1) here. âœ…

Letâ€™s **verify properly**:

---

**Observations:**

* Both `A` and `B` can vanish (`Îµ` productions).
* `S â†’ AaAb` can reduce to `aab` (all A's vanish).
* `S â†’ BbBa` can reduce to `bba` (all B's vanish).

â†’ So the two forms that `S` can eventually generate are:

```
aab
bba
```

**Important:**
The two right-hand sides **start with different terminals** (`a` vs `b`).

* So if first symbol is `a`, it is uniquely from `AaAb`.
* If first symbol is `b`, it is uniquely from `BbBa`.

**Hence no shift/reduce or reduce/reduce conflict** when building parsing table.

---

**About Merging States:**

When building **LALR(1)**, we merge states that have **same core** (items without lookaheads).

But here:

* Since the two forms start with different first terminals (`a` and `b`),
* And both sides are different even after epsilon reductions,
* **There are no cores that are identical across states**.

Thus **no states can be merged** when going from CLR(1) to LALR(1).

### Conclusion:

| Property      | Result                          |
| :------------ | :------------------------------ |
| CLR(1)        | Yes                             |
| LALR(1)       | Yes                             |
| States Merged | No (because cores are distinct) |

---

### Final verification:

âœ… Your understanding is **absolutely correct** for this grammar!

If you want, I can even draw the LR(1) automaton to show how the states differ and why they don't merge. Would you like that? ðŸŽ¯
